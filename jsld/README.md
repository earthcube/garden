# JS LD

# About

This is a simple test of using a JS library to act on JSON-LD.
The main focus is on the Framing API to extract subgraphs to pass to 
web components.

This will be exposed in a service page...   associated now by the
name "fence".   


.../tool/fence?[URL]

Where the URL is then parsed for JSON-LD, then acted on by a set of 
components to show the result of framing and processing results.   Some
initial ideas include (map, geologic time, sample IDs, people, contact info
properties and more)
