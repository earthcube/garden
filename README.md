### About the Garden

This is the test repository for Project 418.  It is where you will find some experiments with different ideas. 
Some of these ideas may or may not show up in various forms in the production code.

#### Garden items

##### blankNodeApproaches
We need to deal with taking JSON-LD and getting it to RDF.  Typical JSON-LD results in many blank 
nodes and this code is looking at some issues around that and how to deal with them.

##### stencilWebComponents
The web ui will be all component based.  This is a test directory for the Stencil component library 
to evaluate it for use.

##### wikipedia-query
This is a web component the author published to webcomoponents.org.  I pulled it down here to review its
patterns for use in the web UI.

#### headlessChrome
At some point in P418 it would be interesting to use headless chrome to make screen shots 
of the pages and use in the display.   The hidden reason for this though is to look at headless
chrome as the page render in order to potentially get at data in .js or web components which dont
render on read for simple library driven GET.
